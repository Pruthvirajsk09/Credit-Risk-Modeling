# Credit-Risk-Modeling

🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing financial data to predict loan default risk using machine learning. The pipeline involves comprehensive data preprocessing — including cleaning, feature engineering, encoding, and handling multicollinearity — followed by model training and hyperparameter tuning. The goal is to create a robust predictive model that can assist financial institutions in assessing loan risks.

🎯 Project Objectives
✅ Clean and preprocess raw data.

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns.

✅ Engineer meaningful features to improve model performance.

✅ Apply feature selection techniques to eliminate irrelevant or redundant variables.

✅ Handle multicollinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).

✅ Apply Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IV) analysis for variable predictiveness.

✅ Encode categorical features for modeling.

✅ Scale numerical features.

✅ Train machine learning models for loan default prediction.

✅ Fine-tune models using Randomized Search CV for hyperparameter optimization.

🏗️ Project Workflow
### 🔹1. Data Cleaning
